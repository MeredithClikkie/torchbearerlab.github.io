City Walls,"Square up with me, I can take your right, throw a left
 Pair up with me, I'm a take you right to the chest
 Warpath etched in the surface
 Lines of the yellow tape, they're moving quiet like a
 Serpentine in a formation
 Buddy, that's my team, pretty impatient
 Now they're waiting on me
 It might be the furthest we've reached
 Now move it up, move it up, it's a breach

 I wonder where you are
 I wanted you to show me
 The way around the city walls
 The way on through
 I wonder where you are
 I wanted you to show me
 But now the night has fallen
 Abandoned by the sun

 Square up with me, I can come to you, tell me when
 Pair up with me, I can run on you, in the end
 I write a promise in pencil, but my loyalty's in pen
 Use a mistake as a crooked stencil, then we trace it back again
 From the mainland to the island of violence
 It was the same plan for a while, decided
 To send me up and rip you outta your seat
 You see, in a city with no entrance, there is not a retreat
 I'm wondering what you thought would happen, who you thought I would be
 Was this a sideswipe or did you picture this in a dream?
 Buckle down, this is possibly the furthest we've reached
 Now move it up, move it up, it's a breach

 I wonder where you are
 I wanted you to show me
 The way around the city walls
 The way on through
 I wonder where you are
 I wanted you to show me
 But now the night has fallen
 Abandoned by the sun
 Abandoned by the sun

 My smile wraps around my head, splitting it in
 Two, two, two, two
 I don't have a clue how I can keep the top half
 Glued, glued, glued, glued
  My smile wraps around my head, splitting it in
 Two, two, two, two
  I don't have a clue how I can keep the top half
 Glued, glued, glued, glued

  I wonder where you are
I wanted you to show me

 Entertain my, entertain my
 Entertain my, entertain my
 Entertain my, entertain my
 Entertain my, entertain my faith
  This is the last time, this is the last time
 Entertain my faith
 This is the last time that I try
 Address my soul, address my soul, address my soul
 Entertain my faith
 This is the last time that I try"

 'Cause proof is in the opposite
