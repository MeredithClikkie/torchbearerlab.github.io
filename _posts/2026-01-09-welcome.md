# Hello World!

I'm using this space to document my projects and research.


A great data report always starts with an executive summary. The BreachThemes.md and AllALbumlyrics.md espesially translates the cold numbers—like "0.15 Rhyme Density"—into a story about artistic growth.

### Summary of Findings: The Lyrical Evolution of Twenty One Pilots

This analysis of **92 songs** across **7 albums** reveals a band in a state of constant technical and thematic transition. Early eras, specifically the *Self-Titled* and *Vessel* periods, are characterized by high **Lexical Diversity** and overt **Faith & Resilience** themes, suggesting a raw, introspective focus on identity and spiritual struggle. As the discography progresses into the *Trench* and *Clancy* eras, we observe a significant spike in **Rhyme Density**, indicating a shift toward more complex, technical rapping and world-building "Lore."

While later albums like *Scaled And Icy* show a higher **Repetition Score** (suggesting a move toward more structured, formulaic pop compositions), the **Sentiment Analysis** reveals a "U-shaped" emotional journey: starting with heavy introspection, moving into dark narrative conflict, and eventually rebounding toward a resilient, albeit complex, optimism. Ultimately, the data suggests that while the band's structural complexity varies by era, their technical proficiency and thematic depth have consistently deepened over the last 15 years.
