# Welcome to Torchbearer Lab

### Option 1: The Automated Link
This link is generated by Jekyll. If your `_config.yml` is correct, this is the "proper" way:
* [Read our Welcome Post (Jekyll Link)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2025-12-31-welcome %})

---

### Option 2: The Manual Link
This is a direct path. If the one above doesn't work, this one usually will:
* [Read our Welcome Post (Manual Link)](./2025/12/31/welcome.html)
